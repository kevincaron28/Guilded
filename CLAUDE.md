# Working on Guilded

Discord bot (`src/`) + WoW addon (`addon/Guilded/`) + companion uploader
(`companion/`, `companion-app/`), one product shipped together (they share a
version number). TypeScript/Node/Prisma/Postgres on the bot side, Lua on the
addon side. Full context: `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` (setup), `docs/DEPLOY_ORACLE.md`
(how the live bot gets updated), `docs/CHARACTER_PAIRING_HANDOFF.md` (one
feature's design notes, as an example of this file's format for a specific
feature).

This file is for whichever agent picks this repo up next — including a cloud
session with no access to this machine's local state. If you're running
somewhere that can't reach Neon or Discord and has no `.env.local`, that's
normal; see below.

## Before you consider anything done

Run both, always — `tsc` passing is not enough on its own:

```
npx tsc --noEmit -p .
npx vitest run
```

Two failure modes only the test suite catches, not the type checker:

- **`/setup` and `/config` are merged into one Discord command**
  (`src/commands/index.ts`'s `MergedCommand`) that sits close to Discord's
  4000-character total-text limit across every subcommand/option/choice name
  and description combined. Adding text anywhere in `src/commands/setup.ts`
  or `src/commands/settings.ts` can push it over with no type error — only
  `tests/commands-shape.test.ts` ("keeps every command under Discord's size
  limit") catches it. If it fails, trim wording; don't just raise the limit.
- **French translations are enforced for specific files only.** Any new
  `tx(lang, "...")` / `T("...")` call in `src/commands/setup.ts`,
  `src/services/setup-status.ts`, `src/commands/craft-board.ts`,
  `src/commands/dungeon-group.ts`, `src/commands/poll.ts`,
  `src/services/raid-core.ts`, or `src/commands/wcl.ts` needs a matching
  entry in `src/i18n-fr.ts`, or `tests/i18n-fr.test.ts` fails. Other files
  aren't checked (e.g. `src/commands/help.ts` keeps its own separate
  `en`/`fr` arrays, not `tx()`).

## No database or Discord access from here

This sandbox (and likely yours) can't reach the production Neon database or
the Discord API — there's no `.env.local` (it's gitignored; holds the bot
token, `DATABASE_URL`, `COMPANION_UPLOAD_TOKEN`) and no live connection even
when one is configured for local dev. Consequences:

- **Migrations are hand-written, not generated.** Don't run
  `prisma migrate dev` (needs a reachable database). Instead, add a field to
  `prisma/schema.prisma`, then hand-write
  `prisma/migrations/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<name>/migration.sql` with plain
  `ALTER TABLE` statements, using the next chronological timestamp after the
  most recent migration folder. Run `npx prisma generate` afterward so the
  TypeScript client matches (this works offline).
- **Never invent or commit a secret** to make something "work" locally —
  hardcoded tokens, a committed `.env`, a fallback credential in code. If a
  task seems to need real credentials, it needs a human with access, not a
  workaround.
- **Never suggest running the bot itself** (`npm run dev`, `start-bot.bat`)
  from an agent session. If a real bot is already live on Oracle, a second
  instance with the same token answers every Discord command twice. Verify
  behavior through the test suite and, where relevant, the Lua test harness
  (`tests/lua/`, fengari — fully offline, no external dependencies), not by
  starting a live bot.

## Deployment happens on the maintainer's PC, not here

The live bot runs on an Oracle Cloud VM, updated by `redeploy-oracle.bat`,
which requires an SSH key that only exists on the maintainer's machine. An
agent session (cloud or local) cannot deploy. The flow is: push to `main` on
GitHub, then the maintainer runs `redeploy-oracle.bat` themselves. Don't
attempt SSH, don't ask for deploy credentials — just get the code and tests
right and land it on `main`.

## `package.json`'s version has a live side effect

`src/services/version-announce.ts` posts a one-time "Guilded was updated to
vX.Y.Z" notice to every guild's bot-guide channel the first time the running
version differs from what that guild was last told (checked once per bot
startup, in `src/main.ts`'s `ClientReady` handler). Don't bump the version
number incidentally (e.g. as a side effect of a dependency update) — treat it
as a real, user-facing announcement trigger, not a housekeeping field.

## Where things live (for a fresh session)

- `src/commands/` — one file per Discord slash command; `src/commands/index.ts`
  registers them and merges a few into parents (see `MergedCommand` above).
- `src/services/` — business logic, called by commands and by scheduled jobs
  in `src/main.ts`.
- `src/setup-names.ts` — the single source of truth for every channel
  `/setup` can create (name/topic in English and French, permissions,
  category). Adding a new bot-managed channel starts here.
- `companion/` — the Node/CLI half of the uploader (also embedded in
  `companion-app/`, the Electron desktop app); `companion/engine.mjs` is the
  shared logic both use.
- `addon/Guilded/` — the WoW Lua addon; `tests/lua/` runs the real `.lua`
  files against a mocked game client (fengari), not a JS reimplementation.
